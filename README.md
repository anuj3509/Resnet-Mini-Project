# Deep Learning Mini Project

This is the code for training and testing a ResNet model with a constraint of less than 5 million parameters. We achieved almost comparable accuracies compared to the original ResNet18 which has almost thrice the number of parameters than our model. We see test accuracies in the 90s range which are commendable.
